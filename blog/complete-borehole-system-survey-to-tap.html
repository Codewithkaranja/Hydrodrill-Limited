              <h2>1) What “complete borehole system” really means</h2>
              <p>
                In Kenya, many projects fail not because there’s “no water,” but because the system was planned backwards.
                A complete setup is a chain where each step informs the next: <strong>survey → drilling → testing → pump → power → storage → plumbing</strong>.
                If any link is weak, you feel it at the tap—low pressure, frequent dry-outs, high power costs, or pump failures.
              </p>

              <div class="callout">
                <strong>System mindset:</strong> Your end goal is dependable litres per day at usable pressure—not just reaching water underground.
              </div>
            </div>

            <div class="section" id="step1">
              <h2>2) Step 1: Define demand (the part most people skip)</h2>
              <p>
                Start by estimating how much water you need per day and when you need it (morning peaks vs continuous use).
                This single step controls your required yield, tank size, pipe sizing, and whether solar makes sense.
                Without demand, it’s easy to buy the wrong pump and then blame the borehole later.
              </p>

            <div class="section" id="step2">
              <h2>3) Step 2: Local context (nearby boreholes)</h2>
              <p>
                Before any survey, collect what you can from nearby boreholes because it’s real-world evidence.
                Ask for facts: depth, yield behavior in dry months, and any quality problems like salinity, staining, or scaling.
                This helps you set realistic expectations and also improves survey targeting.

              <h2>4) Step 3: Hydrogeological survey (siting)</h2>
              <p>
                A hydrogeological survey reduces risk by selecting the best drilling point and estimating likely formation layers.
                In many Kenyan settings, geophysical methods like electrical resistivity (often including VES) are used to infer subsurface changes with depth.
                A good survey doesn’t promise miracles—it gives you a smarter probability and avoids obvious poor zones.
              </p>

              <div class="callout">
                <strong>Deliverables to ask for:</strong> recommended drilling point(s), interpreted layers, likely depth range, and a report you can use for comparable drilling quotes.

              <h2>5) Step 4: Drilling & borehole construction basics</h2>
              <p>
                Drilling is where the “invisible” engineering happens.
                Proper construction protects the borehole from collapse, improves performance, and makes maintenance possible later.
                Even with a good aquifer, weak construction can cause sand pumping, turbidity, and early pump wear.
              </p>

              </ul>

              <div class="callout" style="border-left-color: var(--warning-color);">
                <strong>Red flag:</strong> If you’re rushed to install a pump immediately after drilling with no development/testing, expect problems.

            <div class="section" id="step5">
              <h2>6) Step 5: Development + test pumping</h2>
              <p>
                Development cleans the borehole and improves water entry into the well.
                Test pumping is where you stop guessing: it checks how the borehole behaves under pumping—yield, recovery, and stability.
                This step protects your pump budget because pump sizing should follow confirmed performance, not hopes.
              </p>

              <div class="callout">
                <strong>Simple rule:</strong> Don’t buy the final pump until test pumping data is clear (or you risk buying twice).

            <div class="section" id="step6">
              <h2>7) Step 6: Water quality testing</h2>
              <p>
                If water is for drinking, quality matters as much as quantity.
                Even for non-drinking use, quality affects plumbing: scaling damages heaters, salinity can corrode, and iron can stain tanks and clothes.
                Testing helps you decide if you need filtration, softening, or specific pipe materials.
              </p>

              <h2>8) Step 7: Pump sizing + installation</h2>
              <p>
                Pump sizing is the bridge between “the borehole can yield X” and “the tap feels strong.”
                Correct sizing considers depth, dynamic water level, pipe losses, desired pressure, and whether you’re filling a tank or pressurizing direct lines.
                A pump that is too big can overdraw the borehole and cause frequent dry-running; too small can frustrate users.
              </p>

                <li><span class="icon">✓</span><div><strong>Match pump to tested yield</strong><br><span class="muted">Bigger is not better if the borehole cannot sustainably supply it.</span></div></li>
                <li><span class="icon">✓</span><div><strong>Protect the pump</strong><br><span class="muted">Dry-run protection, correct controller settings, and stable power save pumps.</span></div></li>

            </div>

            <div class="section" id="step8">
              <h2>9) Step 8: Power options (solar vs electricity)</h2>
              <p>
                Power is a major lifetime cost, so plan it early.
                Solar works brilliantly for tank-filling during daytime, while grid power can be better for continuous or night-heavy demand.
                The “best” choice depends on your daily litres, pumping hours, and whether you have storage.
              </p>

              <div class="callout">
                <strong>Practical combo:</strong> Many setups use solar as primary for filling tanks and grid/generator as backup when needed.

            <div class="section" id="step9">
              <h2>10) Step 9: Storage, pressure & distribution to taps</h2>
              <p>
                Storage tanks are the secret weapon for comfort and stability.
                Instead of forcing the borehole to meet every peak hour instantly, you pump steadily into storage, then distribute smoothly.
                Good distribution includes correct pipe sizing, pressure control, and leak checks—these are the final “tap experience” makers.

                Most expensive problems come from skipping steps or mixing contractors without a single plan.
                Here are the common traps that turn a good borehole into a frustrating system.

              <h2>13) FAQ</h2>

              <details>
                <summary>What does “complete borehole system” include?</summary>
                <p>
                  It includes siting/survey, drilling and construction, development and test pumping, water quality testing,
                  pump sizing and installation, power setup (solar/electric), storage tank, pressure system, and plumbing distribution to taps.
                </p>
              </details>

              <details>
                <summary>Should I install a pump immediately after drilling?</summary>
                <p>
                  It’s safer to develop and test pump first. Those results guide pump sizing and reduce the chance of buying the wrong pump.
                </p>
              </details>

              <details>
                <summary>Why do some boreholes “have water” but still give weak taps?</summary>
                <p>
                  Often the issue is system design: undersized pipes, no storage buffer, poor pressure control, incorrect pump sizing,
                  leaks, or demand that exceeds sustainable yield.
                </p>
              </details>

              <details>
                <summary>Is solar always the best choice?</summary>
                <p>
                  Solar is excellent for tank-filling and daytime pumping, but the best choice depends on demand timing, storage capacity,
                  and whether you need continuous pressure at night.
                </p>

                A complete system = survey → drilling → test pumping → water test → pump + power → tank → plumbing.
                Most failures come from skipping testing or designing without storage and correct pipe sizing.
